# RL Environment for CQA Dataset
We have provided a simple RL environment for doing **Question answering over the CQA dataset using Wikidata Knowledge base**.
* **Step 1:** The RL environment is located at **NPI/RL_ENVIRONMENT_CSQA/code/** directory.
* **Step 2:** To incorporate the environment one has to simply import the **environment.py** file.
* **Step 3:** To instantiate an environment you will need to input a parameter file. Sample parameter files are located in the **parameters** folder. 
* **Step 4** A detailed and sufficient instruction on using and instantiating an environment object is provided in the **sample_env_usage.ipynb** notebook.
